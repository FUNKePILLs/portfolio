            <p> I've been using Photoshop and Illustrator for a bit over a year now, and I'm quite skilled at it, and I'm learning more. </p>
            <p> I can retouch photos, focus on subjects, take objects out of a picture, crop and mask, feather, and modify in Photoshop.
                I use Illustrator for graphic design as it is raster-based, meaning I can work with images of any scale without quality loss. 
                Illustrator is very flexible and I've got up to a point where I can maintain a good workflow and be quick in my projects whilst maintaining good quality. </p>
            <p> I've put time into learning both After Effects and Premiere Pro, wherein I can create video compostions, like advertisements, and informative videos. </p>
            <p> I've created graphic and video projects for a cryptocurrency startup back in 2018
                where I designed their logos and website banners, and participated in video essay
                competitions where I made short ad videos about their cryptocurrency, LBC. I was compensated well for my works. </p>

            <h4> Web Design </h4>
            <p> I'm quite adept at both HTML and CSS, both of which I've used to code this website by hand, and I have been actively learning it since late 2017. </p>
            <p> As for Javascript, I'm still learning more of it, but I have the basics down. </p>
